Ang Lv (吕昂) is currently a second year Ph.D. student at [Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence (GSAI)](http://ai.ruc.edu.cn/english/index.htm) in [Renmin University of China (RUC)](https://en.ruc.edu.cn), supervised by [Prof. Rui Yan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=eLw6g-UAAAAJ&hl=en). 

My research primarily focuses on NLP generation tasks. Starting in 2023, I shifted my focus towards long-context ability of LLMs and mechanistic interpretability. I am dedicated to creating more powerful foundation models. 

# News Within a Year

- *2024.05* I am successfully selected by 2024 CCF-Tencent Rhino-Bird Elite Talent Program, mentored by Dr. [Ruobing Xie](https://ruobingxie.github.io/).

- *2024.05* Two papers are accepted by ACL 2024 main conference. One paper is accepted by ACL 2024 findings.

- *2024.04* One paper is accepted by IJCAI 2024.

- *2024.03*: We thoroughly studied the [mechanisms of factual recall in Transformer-based language models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19521), and I hope you will find the exciting findings engaging!

- *2023.11*: We found that using the next-token prediction training paradigm leads to insufficient training data utility, and the model cannot fully grasp knowledge in the training data, leading to the ["reversal curse."](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07468)
