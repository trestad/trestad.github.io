Ang Lv (ÂêïÊòÇ) is currently a second year Ph.D. student at [Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence (GSAI)](http://ai.ruc.edu.cn/english/index.htm) in [Renmin University of China (RUC)](https://en.ruc.edu.cn), supervised by [Prof. Rui Yan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=eLw6g-UAAAAJ&hl=en). 

My research primarily focuses on NLP generation tasks. Starting in 2023, I shifted my focus towards mechanistic interpretability. Through a deep understanding of language models, I am dedicated to creating more powerful foundation models. 

# üî• News Within a Year

- *2024.03*: I thoroughly studied the [mechanisms of factual recall in Transformer-based language models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19521), and I hope you will find the exciting findings engaging!

- *2023.12*: I found some [drawbacks in RoPE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04455), which limit the LLMs' context awareness to some specific positions. My coauthor and I mitigated this issue and enhanced a 7B model to outperform GPT-4 in a tool-use benchmark!

- *2023.11*: I found that using the next-token prediction training paradigm leads to insufficient training data utility, and the model cannot fully grasp knowledge in the training data, leading to the ["reversal curse."](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07468)
