Ang Lv (ÂêïÊòÇ) is currently a second year Ph.D. student at [Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence (GSAI)](http://ai.ruc.edu.cn/english/index.htm) in [Renmin University of China (RUC)](https://en.ruc.edu.cn), supervised by [Prof. Rui Yan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=eLw6g-UAAAAJ&hl=en). 
His researches focus on generation tasks in NLP. 

He lacks any sci-fi knowledge about LLM agents ü§£ and is unlikely to try prompt engineering ü•±, unless someone can provide him with a clear definition of the terms "hallucination," "planning," and "reasoning" as used in their NLP paper. There's just something he is or was interested in.
