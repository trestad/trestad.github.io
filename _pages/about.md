I am currently a second year Ph.D. student at [Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence (GSAI)](http://ai.ruc.edu.cn/english/index.htm) in Renmin University of China, supervised by [Prof. Rui Yan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=eLw6g-UAAAAJ&hl=en). I focus on long-context ability and mechanistic interpretability of LLMs. I am dedicated to creating more powerful foundation models.
