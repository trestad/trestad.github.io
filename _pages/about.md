Ang Lv (ÂêïÊòÇ) is currently a second year Ph.D. student at [Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence (GSAI)](http://ai.ruc.edu.cn/english/index.htm) in [Renmin University of China (RUC)](https://en.ruc.edu.cn), supervised by [Prof. Rui Yan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=eLw6g-UAAAAJ&hl=en). 

My research primarily centers around NLP generation tasks. Starting in 2023, my focus has shifted towards the mechanistics interpretability. I've undertaken various endeavors, including efforts to [analyse the phenomenon known as the "reversal curse"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07468) and investigating [the potential constraints posed by position embeddings on LLM's context awareness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04455). Looking ahead, I am committed to further delving into this area.
